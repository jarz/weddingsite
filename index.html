			<h2>About Jenna & Tim</h2>
		</header>
		<span>This love story begins like all other great love stories before it... on the internet. Thanks to the power
			of the world wide web, comparably nerdy individuals both originally from Northwest Indiana found each other
			in Indianapolis.</span>
		<br /><br />
		<span>The internet convinced our main characters they had enough in common to motivate a relatively awkward
			first date at a subpar restaurant. Thankfully the awkwardness of the first date was not enough to discourage
			a second date. For her, it was because he donated his old car to the local NPR station, for him, it was
			because she had traveled around the world. The second date was much less awkward and thankfully lead to many
			more dates and a successful birthday trip to Nashville. So successful in fact, that soon after that our main
			characters decided to live together, combine their households, and start a zoo comprised of two cats and a
			dog.</span>
		<br /><br />
		<span>Since moving in together, they have traveled to Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, Ireland and Scotland.
			They have also visited delicious restaurants, explored museums and galleries, saw amazing concerts (one so
			great they got engaged during it), fell more in love with Indianapolis and each other. They love each other
			so much, that they want to celebrate their love with you. Jenna and Tim hope their nuptials give all their
			guests a glimpse into both their love for each other, as well as the city that they love.</span>

		<span>Our guest list is pretty small and the room blocks we looked into only offered a discount of a few dollars
			(literally $3). You can usually find better discounts on hotel booking sites or even
			booking directly with the hotel of your choice. Instead of offering a minimal discount at one hotel, we figured our
			guests would be better off choosing what works best for them. Here are a few suggestions in a couple of
			price points.
